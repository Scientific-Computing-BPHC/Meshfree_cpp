# Meshfree_cpp

Scientific Computing @ BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus.

Development of a meshfree solver for inviscid compressible fluid flows, in C++. The meshfree solver is based on the Least Squares
Kinetic Upwind Method (LSKUM).

This work is done as part of my M.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics Thesis, under the guidance of Dr. N. Anil, Department of Hyderabad, BITS-Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

Instructions to run:

* clone the repo
* run `./batchscript`
